        "This task aimed to improve the movie recommendation system by incorporating user age groups. The solution involved several steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning:** The movie data was loaded from a CSV file, and missing values in 'director', 'cast', and 'country' were handled. Duplicates were removed.\n",
        "2.  **Age Group to Rating Mapping:** Defined user age groups (Children, Teens, Adults) and mapped them to appropriate movie/TV show ratings (e.g., G, PG, PG-13, R, TV-Y, TV-MA, etc.).\n",
        "3.  **Data Wrangling:** The data was filtered to include only movies and shows with ratings relevant to the defined age groups.\n",
        "4.  **Feature Engineering:** A new feature, \"release_decade\", was created to group movies by their release decade.\n",
        "5.  **Model Development:** The `recommend_movies` function was modified to accept a user's `age_group` and `decade` to suggest relevant titles.\n",
        "6.  **Model Evaluation:** The recommendation system was tested with various age groups and decades, demonstrating its ability to provide age-appropriate recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "The movie recommendation system was successfully enhanced to provide recommendations based on user age groups and preferred release decades. This allows for more tailored suggestions suitable for Children, Teens, and Adults by filtering based on a predefined mapping of age groups to content ratings. The system remains a content-based filtering approach, now with an added dimension of age-appropriateness.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Insights and Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "The current system offers a good starting point for age-based recommendations. To further enhance it:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Refine Age-Rating Mappings:** The current age-to-rating mapping is based on general assumptions. This could be refined using official guidelines or allowing for more granular age inputs.\n",
        "*   **Incorporate Genre Preferences:** Allow users to specify preferred genres in addition to their age group for more personalized recommendations.\n",
        "*   **User Profiles and Learning:** Implement user profiles that store preferences and viewing history to enable more sophisticated recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering or hybrid approaches).\n",
        "*   **Content Analysis:** Utilize content-based filtering by analyzing movie descriptions, cast, director, etc., to find similarities beyond just rating and release decade.\n",
        "*   **Feedback Mechanism:** Allow users to rate recommendations or indicate if they are not appropriate, which can help improve the system over time.\n",
        "*   **Develop a User Interface:** Create a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the recommendation system.\n",
        "\n",
        "By addressing these areas, the recommendation system can be significantly improved, providing a more engaging, personalized, and robust experience for users.\n"
